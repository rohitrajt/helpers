# helpers

This project is a collection of helper utilities which I frequently use

## Oozie Job Submitter
This project is useful to quickly submit oozie jobs. It can also listen to status of the oozie jobs using oozie's callback mechanism

## Pig Script Runner
This project uses cloudera pig and pigunit distribution to run pig scripts and validate the results.
